# Prediction-of-EC2-Spot-Pricing-for-AWS
Spots are defined as unused EC2 capacity. AWS spot instances allows users to access the unused compute capacity at steep discounts as compared to on-demand prices. The main benefit of these instances are that the users can optimize costs on AWS cloud and scale applications throughput up to 10 times for the same budget. But to use spot instances user needs to bid price for the instance and the instance will only spin up when the EC2 spot price is lower than the specified bid price. These spot prices fluctuate based on the demand and supply of the available capacity of the EC2 resulting in interrupted execution of these instances.  We are planning to build a system which can predict the spot price for users before placing their bids.
